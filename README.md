Network Protocol Simulations
============================

Simulations of Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N, Selective-Repeat protocols.
These were made for Computer Networks Lab Assignment at IIT Roorkee.

In order to simulate any one of the protocols, first start up the `noisy-channel` in one terminal, switch to another terminal and start up the `sender`, and the corresponding `receiver` in yet another terminal.
